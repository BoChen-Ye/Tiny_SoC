# Tiny_SoC
This is my hobby project. After I study [RSIC-V CPU](https://github.com/BoChen-Ye/RISC-V-five-stage-CPU) and [AI accelerator](https://github.com/BoChen-Ye/Tiny_LeViT_Hardware_Accelerator), I wonder how to connect them with bus, so I make this Tiny_SoC project.

This is not a serious project, so it must be very simple and have many problems. I finish this project with ChatGPT which help me a lot.

Anyway, this project is only for study and understanding SoC.
